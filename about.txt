<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I am an inquisitive student aiming for a career in Engineering.<br>
			As a middle school student, I was fascinated with Unexplored Environments and Transportation Systems, especially Trains, Aeroplanes, Spacecrafts and Rockets. In middle school, I remember exploring on various topics of Science and Technology.
			<ul>
				<li>What is Space? Why is there no air up there?
				<li>What is it like, to go into space and live there? 
				<li>How would humans feel staying on other planets? Are there other creatures out there?
				<li>How aeroplanes fly? - Why do they have wings? Why do they have engines?
				<li>Why did the world switch from Propellers to Jet planes?
				<li>What are Steam, Diesel and Electric Locomotives? Why isn't Steam Locomotive used to run trains anymore?
				<li>How do rockets escape "gravity"? Why don't they return back to ground the way a ball does?
				<li>How do spacecrafts move around in space? How do they have so much energy to last for years in space without refueling?
			</ul>
			As I got answers to these questions, I would ask further and learn more. <br>
			This is around the time I switched my TV channels from Cartoons to Science and Technology. From Pokemon, Tom & Jerry, and Beyblade every evening at 5 (as soon as I came home from school), my favorite shows became "I didn't know that", Megastructures, Man vs Wild and Air Crash Investigation on National Georaphic and Discovery. Meanwhile, Computers fascinated me. I tried to learn about how games, internet and websites were built. I started learning HTML, a language to make websites.<br>
			Towards the end of 6<sup>th</sup> grade, I joined a Science Club in my neighbourhood. It was my foundation to pursue Engineering. I was taught Math and Science concepts ahead of schoolwork. I was proud to know a little bit of Trigonometry, Digital Logic Design, Circuit Design, Measurement and Precision Mechanics in the 7<sup>th</sup> grade.<br>
			In high school, I concentrated on working on my skills to become an Engineer. In 8<sup>th</sup> grade, I wrote the National Talent Search Examination with very little preperation to test my skills which did not involve memory and learning by rote. I was selected for the State level and National level but did not get through the interview. This was the first time I realized my weakness - Talking to interviewers. In 9<sup>th</sup> grade, I participated in lots of extra-curriculars. I obtained 2<sup>nd</sup> place in a German Poster Competition organized through a School Exchange Program. As a result, I got the opportunity to learn a foreign language - German - in a leading institute. I also discovered my love for Computers. I used to switch programs in my Computer lab and try new softwares and make websites. My Computer teacher asked me to write a certain test outside school. This was in Infosys Campus in Bangalore. I wrote it and couldn't believe I was placed in the top 10 students among 300 top rankers from Bangalore schools. I later learned that performing well in these "Aptitude" tests was my strength. As a top scorer, I was invited to attend a workshop on "Information Technology and Computer Programming", which was an inspiring experience. <br>
			In 10<sup>th</sup> grade, I helped gather a team in school to participate in an internation competition - NASA AMES Space Settlement Contest. I co-lead the team and helped in integrating the entire project. We received the 2<sup>nd</sup> prize worldwide and were invited to present at the International Space Development Conference by the National Space Society at Huntsville, AL, USA. This was an amazing experience for me, as I learned about the entire Space Industry in the world.<br>
			11<sup>th</sup> was a big leap from 10<sup>th</sup> in terms of syllabus, as I chose my subjects - Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Computer Science and English. Even though catching up with schoolwork was harder, I focused on extra-curriculars. My space project team started a Near Space Ballooning Project and I took up a lot of responsibilities. I participated in an inter-school Technology fest and a Space Settlement competition. I was given an opportunity to build a website for my School Fest, and I took out all my time off studies to build this. It was my first well-executed professional website, and was launched by my School Secretary and Principal.<br>
			12<sup>th</sup> grade was the last year of school and I was asked to focus on studies. I used this time to learn about Engineering around the world, and how to work towards a successful career in Engineering. I also learned a programming language in detail - C++. I did a major project in C++ which implemented all the concepts I had learned.<br>
			My college years were time I spent focusing on gaining my skills and trying to reach out to the industry level. I boosted my C++ skills. I started learning Arduino and Microcontroller programming in my 1<sup>st</sup> year by attending many workshops. I joined College clubs which focused in Software programming and Electronics design, and did many projects.<br>
			In 2<sup>nd</sup> year, apart from taking up projects, I wanted to contribute to the underprivileged part of my society, and as a result, joined an organization called "Leaders for Tomorrow" and lead a team of 6 college students to teach underprivileged children concepts of Life Skills and Environmental Sciences for 5 weeks in Summer 2015.<br>
			In 3<sup>rd</sup> year, I worked on a project on Star Sensors and co-authored a research paper, titled "Star Sensor Design: Interface Circuit and VHDL Implementation on FPGA" which was published by the Sensors Research Society, and was presented at the National Conference on Sensors: Lab to Field, Sensors 2016 at the Research Centre Imarat, Hyderabad. I also started a few other projects which are currently in progress - <br>
			<ul>
				<li>Memory Based Multi-processor Architecture Design for Star Sensors (video processing)
				<li>Iris Detection and Recognition using OpenCV
				<li>Hardware Project on Advanced Power Electronics
				<li>Software Implementation of computational concepts in Electrical Machinery
			</ul>
			I am currently working on developing my skills and trying to obtain Industry and Research experience through fellowships and internships. I am also looking out for a challenging internship during Summer 2016 to boost my skills and contribute to the professional world.
